Cabaretic

This is an Android mobile app I created using Appcelerator Titanium.

Cabaretic is a musician who is a friend.  

I made a mobile app to provide a face for his YouTube feed.

I wrote the app in Javascript, which Titanium compiled into an Android app.

I composed the graphics on the app using GIMP, a font from dafont.com, and a photo from his YouTube feed.

I based the mobile app off of the website I created for him at http://cabaretic.cairosubway.com.

I want to thank Cabaretic for letting me use his content.
